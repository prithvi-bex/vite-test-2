# Bootes Studio UI Components

UI library for React with Tailwind CSS, Vite, TypeScript and Shadcn-ui components.

### Features
- Tree-shakeable (components you don't use won't be included in your bundle)
- Dark mode support
- Override library styles with your own using tailwindcss or your own css

### Wanna see how this library works ?

Run the example project and play around

Install dependencies:

```
npm install

cd examples/vite-tailwind-app
npm install
```

The example project has the published npm package linked so you do not really have to do a local npm link. But if you want to test, just:

```
npm build
npm link

cd examples/vite-tailwind-app
npm link bootes-studio-ui-components
npm run dev
```
